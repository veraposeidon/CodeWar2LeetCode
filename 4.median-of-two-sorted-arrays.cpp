 * Hard (25.44%)
 * Total Accepted:    384K
 * Total Submissions: 1.5M
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3]\n[2]'
 *
 * There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
 * 
 * Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity
 * should be O(log (m+n)).
 * 
 * You may assume nums1 and nums2Â cannot be both empty.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * nums1 = [1, 3]
 * nums2 = [2]
 * 
 * The median is 2.0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * nums1 = [1, 2]
 * nums2 = [3, 4]
 * 
 * The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
